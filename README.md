# Global COVID-19 Vaccination and Case Outcome Analysis

This project presents a data-driven analysis of the global COVID-19 pandemic with a focus on regional disparities in vaccination coverage and public health outcomes. Utilizing data from the World Health Organization (WHO), the study examines trends in vaccination rates, case fatality ratios, and cumulative case counts across six WHO-defined regions. The goal is to uncover key insights into the effectiveness of pandemic responses and identify systemic challenges in global health equity.

## Objectives
- Investigate how COVID-19 vaccination rates differed across global regions.
- Assess the relationship between vaccination efforts and case fatality rates.
- Analyze temporal trends in pandemic progression across various regions and representative countries.

## Contents
- `final_report_code.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, visualization, and analysis steps.
- `final_report.pdf`: Comprehensive report summarizing the analysis, findings, visualizations, and implications.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy

## Key Findings
- A negative correlation was observed between vaccination rates and case fatality rates across regions.
- Regions with greater healthcare infrastructure, such as Europe and the Western Pacific, demonstrated higher vaccination coverage and lower COVID-19 mortality.
- Lower-income regions, particularly in Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, exhibited significantly lower vaccination rates and higher fatality rates, highlighting global health inequities.
